Dear HR,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in Backend Engineer role. My experience as the solo engineer for system design and full-stack development at current startup team. I built and maintained the LLM workflow. This involved full ownership, using React/TypeScript for the front-end and Python for the back-end. 

I also have DevOps and cloud skills. I've familiar with Linux (env include Arch, Mint), CI/CD (GitHub Actions/TeamCity), and container Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and AWS infrastructure (Lambda, EC2, ....).

Further, I'm expert in syetem lang C++17 in my early career. I'm adaptable, a quick learner, and solve problems effectively. I'm eager to contribute my skills to your team.

I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy building efficient, high-performing systems. Iâ€™d love to discuss how I can contribute to your team. Looking forward to connecting!

Sincerely,
